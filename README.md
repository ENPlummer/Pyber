# Pyber

In this project, I analyzed generated data on a fictional ride sharing company called Pyber. I analyzed the data given to me to determine was a correlation between the type of city and the average fare. In addition to my analysis, I also created visualizations based on the data. These were the key insights that I found:

*	There is a correlation between number of rides and the average fare per city. Urban cities the highest number of rides, the highest number of drivers and had the lowest average fare of the three types of cities.
*	Urban cities have the highest percentage of total fares at 62.97%.
*	Even though rural cities had the highest average fare per city, the rural cities had the smallest segment of the total fares by city pie chart at 6.68%.
*	Urban cities had both the largest percentage of total rides and percentage of drivers.

This project was done completely in my Jupyter Notebook. To do my analysis, I used the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries. I used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create my visualizations.
